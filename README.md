# COMP 1006 - Intro to web programming
A course that includes studying and working with technologies like php, MySQL, Azure, Githug and some other useful web development tools. 
## Purpose
This repository is directly connected to the azure website. Since, this repository is connected to my IDE (phpStorm), when I commit changes from my IDE, it directly updates the repository on github. Azure, then automatically syncs the changes made in this repository and deploy it to the website. I edit files from my local machine, through my IDE, and everything else works automatically, and I'm able to see changes made to my website online, pretty quick. It's a very quick and efficient way for testing or experimenting purposes in a real production environment.
